excerpt: "As an Information Technology Architect, I have spent over two decades in multiple major business verticals using a vast array of technologies to solve business problems. Along the way, I got to develop a unique understanding of how businesses work with IT.
          From that perspective, I intend to share my thoughts and experiences of how businesses get impacted by the latest trends in technology such as Cloud Migration, Microservices Architecture, Containerization, Big Data and others."

People today specialize in one business vertical or focus on one area of technology. Early on I, fortunately, received a rare opportunity, to think, analyze, design, develop and implement software across a large organization,
using all sorts of languages, frameworks, databases, and tools. Those opportunities have prepared me to look through all tools and technologies not look at them. To use technologies as means and not goals, to solve business problems.
Using my background, I intend to share my thoughts and experiences on the latest trends in technologies on the following business domains. Having worked at all of the following, let me share and engage in rich discussion in how technology stands to transform these
 verticals in a significant way.
